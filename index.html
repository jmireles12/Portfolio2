      <h2>Hi. My name is Juan Mireles</h2>
      <!-- My background-->
      <p>I'm a Mexican Native and raised in Texas. I come from a Hispanic culture that values family and tradition. I love to spend quality time with my parents, sister, and wife on weekends.</p>

      <p>When I'm around people, I enjoy seeing everyone happy, so I try to make people laugh or help them when they are struggling. I tend to put other people's needs over mine to help them out.</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <!-- talk about myself-->
        <p>I've always been the type of person that enjoys building stuff. Building websites and apps are topics that I have become very interested in. I'm excited to work with people that are going to show me new ideas and expand my creativity.</p>
    
        <p>I enjoy being around people but, at the same time, am an introvert. I sometimes like being in a quiet and peaceful environment where I can work and think about goals or projects. Every day I look at how I can improve as a person and also improve my skills. I make it a personal goal to learn something new every day; for example, learn a new skill, learn a new word, learn an easier way of doing something, etc.</p>

          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
