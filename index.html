      <h2>Hi. My name is Juan Mireles</h2>
      <!-- My background-->
      <p>I'm a Mexican Native and raised in Texas. I come from a Hispanic culture that values family and tradition. I love to spend quality time with my parents, sister, and wife on weekends.</p>

      <p>When I'm around people, I enjoy seeing everyone happy, so I try to make people laugh or help them when they are struggling. I tend to put other people's needs over mine just to help them out.</p>

    <section id="about" class="group2 item">
        <h2>About me</h2>
        <!-- talk about myself-->
        <p>I've always been the type of person that enjoys building stuff. Building websites and apps are topics that I have become very interested in. I'm excited to work with people that are going to show me new ideas and expand my creativity.</p>
    
        <p>I enjoy being around people but, at the same time, an introvert. I sometimes like being in a quiet and peaceful environment where I can work and think about goals or projects. A project that I have in mind is to set up a website and app where property owners can set up an account where the renter can pay their rent.</p>
